# Work Scheduler

## Description 
This is a work-day scheduler depicting a 9 to 5 work day. The user can add text to the textarea to plan ahead and schedule their day. 
It is a color-coding schedule that shows the time pasted in grey, future time in green and present time in red. So you can keep up with what needs to be done.

### Skills used 
- third-party libraries (bootstrap, jquery and moment.js)
- DOM traversals and manipulations with jquery
- save user input into local storage with jquery
- Used Bootstrap grid for the HTMl layout

(local storage is still being worked on)
